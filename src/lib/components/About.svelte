<div class="about">
	<p>Hello there, I am a recent graduate from DePauw University, now located in NYC.</p>
	<p>
		Currently, not employed so I am open to most tech-related opportunities, software
		engineering/development would be nice.
	</p>
	<p>I (try to) program. Working to get better, with hopefully cooler things in the process.</p>
