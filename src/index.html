                    Hello there, I am a recent graduate from DePauw University,
                    now located in NYC (willing to relocate!). Currently, I am
                    not employed so I am open to most opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dabble in a bunch of things such as web development, game
                    development, and machine learning. I am currently working on
                    my skills in web dev and recenly picked up Rust to create
                    tools and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, my portfolio will likely be constantly updated as I
                    am using this project to learn web animation with GSAP, and
                    also update any new projects this summer.
                </p>
