                <p>
                    Hello there, I am a recent graduate from DePauw University,
                    now located in NYC (willing to relocate!). Currently, I am
                    not employed so I am open to most opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dabble in a bunch of things such as web development, game
                    development, and machine learning. I am currently working on
                    my skills in web dev and recenly picked up Rust to create
                    tools and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, my portfolio will likely be constantly updated as I
                    am using this project (and the next iteration of my
                    portfolio) to learn web animation and also update any new
                    projects this summer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page is built with just vanilla html, css, and js.
                    Since the portfolio's scope has changed abit (I wanted to
                    add a projects section with much more animations), I have
                    decided to create a new version with Svelte.
